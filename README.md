# Python Data Analysis Portfolio
### Introduction
This repository serves as my Python portfolio, featuring a variety of scripts and Jupyter notebooks designed for data analysis, insights, and visualizations.

Data_Analysis is a collection of Python projects that demonstrates different approaches to analyzing datasets, extracting useful insights, and creating valuable visual representations of data. It also highlights my proficiency in using Python to tackle diverse data analysis tasks.

### Features
1. Data Pre-processing
Includes operations for handling missing values, invalid inputs, and detecting outliers.
Ensures clean and high-quality datasets, ready for analysis.
2. Data Analysis
Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.
Apply statistical techniques to better understand the datasets.
3. Data Visualisation
Create informative and engaging visualizations to understand data distributions, relationships, and trends.
Utilizes tools such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for effective visual representation.
4. Customizable Projects
Projects are easily adaptable to suit specific preprocessing and analysis needs.
Code can be tailored for different datasets and objectives, making the repository flexible for a variety of tasks.

### Projects Included
1. FIFA '21
Tools and Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
Highlights: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and creating scatter plots.
2. Stack Overflow annual developer survey
